# SonarScanner Analysis Action

A GitHub Action that runs SonarQube analysis using local Docker containers, providing a self-contained analysis environment without requiring an external SonarQube server.

## Features

- üê≥ Runs SonarQube server and scanner in Docker containers
- üîí Self-contained analysis environment
- üìä Detailed analysis reports as workflow artifacts
- üöÄ Easy integration with existing workflows
- üìù Comprehensive quality metrics and issue tracking
- ‚ö° Supports custom source paths and exclusions

## Prerequisites

- GitHub Actions runner with Docker support (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`)
- Repository access to run workflows

## Usage

Create or update your workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/sonar-analysis.yml`):

```yaml
name: Code Analysis

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run SonarScanner Analysis
        uses: diekotto/sonar-scanner-analysis@v1
        with:
          project-key: your-project-key
          sources: src/
          exclusions: "**/*.test.js,**/node_modules/**"
```

| `sources`         | Source directories to analyze                  | No       | `.`                             |
| `exclusions`      | Patterns to exclude from analysis              | No       | ` ` |
| `wait-for-server` | Max time in seconds to wait for SonarQube server   | No       | `60`                            |
| `retention-days`  | Number of days to retain the analysis artifact | No       | `7`                             |

## Outputs

The action generates a detailed analysis report that includes:

- Project quality gate status
- Key metrics (bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, etc.)
- Issue breakdown by type and severity
- Detailed issue list with file locations and descriptions
- Most commonly violated rules

The report is available as a workflow artifact and is also added to the workflow summary.

## Example Analysis Report
